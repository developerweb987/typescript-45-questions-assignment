// Exercise 35

// Store the names of animals in an array
let animals: string[] = ["Dog", "Cow", "Tiger"];

// Use a for loop to print a statement about each animal
for (let animal of animals) {
    console.log(`A ${animal.toLowerCase()} would make a great pet.`);
}

// Print a statement about what these animals have in common
console.log("Any of these animals would make a great pet!");
