// Exercise 35
// Store the names of animals in an array
var animals = ["Dog", "Cow", "Tiger"];
// Use a for loop to print a statement about each animal
for (var _i = 0, animals_1 = animals; _i < animals_1.length; _i++) {
    var animal = animals_1[_i];
    console.log("A ".concat(animal.toLowerCase(), " would make a great pet."));
}
// Print a statement about what these animals have in common
console.log("Any of these animals would make a great pet!");
